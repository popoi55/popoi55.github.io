            as well as stronger slow punk rock. His songs tend to feature soft synths, strong melodies, layered vocals, and long outros; some of his songs incorporate elements of trap, cinematic rock, and EDM. Demon debuted in 2017 with the pop-rock single "Another Planet," a poorly mastered track, that was released alongside a music video, edited by Demon and Alex - LPA. Later that year Demon released his first album titled "Timeline," which also featured the single "Another Planet," With a new mix and a remix "Another Planet (Lights out Remix)," along with the 15 songs of the album. This album focused on the mentality of an individual, and how someone goes from life to death, but manages to break out of hell, but stays in limbo in the last track "Rebirth." "Timeline," is an album discussing a natural disaster killing the character that the story follows and turning him into Demon.</p></div>
